\hspace{15pt}{\textbf{Section}:Private school22\\}
\\ Context: In many parts of the United States, after the 1954 decision in the landmark court case Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka that demanded United States schools desegregate ''with all deliberate speed'', local families organized a wave of private ''Christian academies''. In much of the U.S. South, many white students migrated to the academies, while public schools became in turn more heavily concentrated with African-American students (see List of private schools in Mississippi). The academic content of the academies was usually College Preparatory. Since the 1970s, many of these ''segregation academies'' have shut down, although some continue to operate.[citation needed] CANNOTANSWER
