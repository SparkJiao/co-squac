\\ Context: In the late 17th century, Robert Boyle proved that air is necessary for combustion. English chemist John Mayow (1641â€“1679) refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called spiritus nitroaereus or just nitroaereus. In one experiment he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air's volume before extinguishing the subjects. From this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion. CANNOTANSWER
