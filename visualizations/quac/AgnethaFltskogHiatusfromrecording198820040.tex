\hspace{15pt}{\textbf{Section}:Agnetha FÃ¤ltskog -- Hiatus from recording (1988-2004)0\\}
\\ Context: Following the release of I Stand Alone, Faltskog had a 17-year hiatus from the music industry, during which she made few public appearances and devoted much of her time to astrology, yoga and horse riding at her isolated country house in Ekero. In 1990, Faltskog married Swedish surgeon Tomas Sonnenfeld, but the couple divorced in 1993. In 1994, Faltskog's mother committed suicide by jumping from her Jonkoping apartment balcony. Faltskog's resulting depression worsened a year later when her father died. In 1997, Faltskog started a relationship with a Dutch forklift driver, Gert van der Graaf, who had been stalking her home and was apparently obsessed with her since his childhood. After Faltskog decided to terminate the relationship two years later, he stalked her further at her mansion, resulting in a court issuing Van der Graaf with a restraining order and deporting him to the Netherlands in 2000. Returning close to her home in 2003, he was arrested and then banned from entering Sweden. In 2005, the ban order from Sweden ran out, and within months van der Graaf was again sighted near Faltskog's estate in Ekero. In 1996, her autobiography Som jag ar was published in Swedish (and in English the following year titled As I Am), followed by several compilation CDs of her Swedish and English recordings, including one called My Love, My Life for which Faltskog picked out the music herself. Fans welcomed the autobiography. The book was updated in 1998 and released worldwide via Virgin Publishing, selling over 50,000 copies. CANNOTANSWER
