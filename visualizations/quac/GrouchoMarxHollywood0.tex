\hspace{15pt}{\textbf{Section}:Groucho Marx -- Hollywood0\\}
\\ Context: Groucho Marx made 26 movies, 13 of them with his brothers Chico and Harpo. Marx developed a routine as a wisecracking hustler with a distinctive chicken-walking lope, an exaggerated greasepaint mustache and eyebrows, and an ever-present cigar, improvising insults to stuffy dowagers (often played by Margaret Dumont) and anyone else who stood in his way. As the Marx Brothers, he and his brothers starred in a series of popular stage shows and movies. Their first movie was a silent film made in 1921 that was never released, and is believed to have been destroyed at the time. A decade later, the team made two of their Broadway hits--The Cocoanuts and Animal Crackers--into movies. Other successful films were Monkey Business, Horse Feathers, Duck Soup, and A Night at the Opera. One quip from Marx concerned his response to Sam Wood, the director of A Night at the Opera. Furious with the Marx Brothers' ad-libs and antics on the set, Wood yelled in disgust: ''You can't make an actor out of clay.'' Groucho responded, ''Nor a director out of Wood.'' Marx also worked as a radio comedian and show host. One of his earliest stints was a short-lived series in 1932, Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel, costarring Chico. Though most of the scripts and discs were thought to have been destroyed, all but one of the scripts were found in 1988 in the Library of Congress. In 1947 Marx was asked to host a radio quiz program You Bet Your Life. It was broadcast by ABC and then CBS before moving to NBC. It moved from radio to television on October 5, 1950 and ran for eleven years. Filmed before a live audience, the show consisted of Marx bantering with the contestants and ad-libbing jokes before briefly quizzing them. The show was responsible for popularizing the phrases ''Say the secret word and the duck will come down and give you fifty dollars,'' ''Who's buried in Grant's Tomb?'' and ''What color is the White House?'' (asked to reward a losing contestant a consolation prize). Throughout his career he introduced a number of memorable songs in films, including ''Hooray for Captain Spaulding'' and ''Hello, I Must Be Going'', in Animal Crackers, ''Whatever It Is, I'm Against It'', ''Everyone Says I Love You'' and ''Lydia the Tattooed Lady''. Frank Sinatra, who once quipped that the only thing he could do better than Marx was sing, made a film with Marx and Jane Russell in 1951 entitled Double Dynamite. CANNOTANSWER
