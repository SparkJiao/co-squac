\hspace{15pt}{\textbf{Section}:John Hartson -- Luton Town and Arsenal0\\}
\\ Context: Hartson turned professional in 1992 and made his Luton Town first team debut as a substitute in a 1-0 League Cup defeat to Cambridge United on 24 August 1993. In January 1995, at 19, he joined Arsenal for PS2.5 million, a British record fee for a teenage player at the time. Along with Chris Kiwomya, Hartson was one of George Graham's last signings before the manager's sacking in February 1995. He made his Arsenal debut on 14 January 1995, a 1-1 home draw with Everton, and scored his first goal for the club the following week, the only goal in a 1-0 away win at Coventry City. He was a regular for the remainder of his first season, a highlight of which was scoring Arsenal's 75th-minute equaliser in the 1995 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final against Real Zaragoza; however a last-minute goal from 40 yards by Nayim over David Seaman meant Arsenal lost the game 2-1. He was strike-partner to Ian Wright, being favoured ahead of Kevin Campbell to fill the gap left by the injured Alan Smith, who would retire at the end of the season. Following the signing of Dennis Bergkamp, who was preferred up front to partner Wright, Hartson went on to feature under Graham's successors Bruce Rioch and Arsene Wenger. With Wenger wanting him to stay at the club, Hartson though in February 1997 linked up with West Ham United in a PS3.2 million deal. At the time, he was the most expensive player to be signed by West Ham.The deal was initially reported to be worth PS5 million. In total, Hartson played 53 times for Arsenal, scoring 14 goals.
