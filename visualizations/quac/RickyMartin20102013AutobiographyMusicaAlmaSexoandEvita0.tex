\hspace{15pt}{\textbf{Section}:Ricky Martin -- 2010-2013: Autobiography, Musica + Alma + Sexo and Evita0\\}
\\ Context: Ricky Martin's autobiography, Me, was published on November 2, 2010. The book became part of The New York Times Best Seller list, debuting at number five on the Hardcover Nonfiction list. A Spanish-language edition entitled Yo was published simultaneously. Martin's single, ''The Best Thing About Me Is You'' featuring Joss Stone also premiered on November 2, 2010 and peaked at number seventy-four on the Billboard Hot 100. The Spanish version, ''Lo Mejor de Mi Vida Eres Tu'' topped the Hot Latin Songs for two weeks. It was followed by a new studio album, Musica + Alma + Sexo released on January 31, 2011. It debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and became the highest charting, primarily-Spanish language album in the United States, since Dreaming of You by Selena. Musica + Alma + Sexo also represents the highest ever chart debut on the Billboard 200 for a Sony Music Latin release. It spent two weeks at number one on the Billboard Top Latin Albums. On March 25, 2011, Martin started his Musica + Alma + Sexo World Tour, which ended on November 12, 2011. The second single from the album, ''Mas'' was released on April 5, 2011 and peaked at number seven on the Hot Dance Club Songs. ''Frio'' featuring Wisin & Yandel was chosen as the third single. 17: Greatest Hits was released on July 11, 2011 exclusively in the United Kingdom. Ricky Martin was playing Che in the Broadway revival of the show Evita, scheduled to begin previews on Broadway in March 2012, ahead of an opening in April 2012. He received mixed reviews. Martin guest-starred as a Spanish teacher on the Fox TV show Glee episode ''The Spanish Teacher'' on February 7, 2012. Martin premiered his ''Ricky's Lip Conditioner'' lip balm in April 2012 as part of the M.A.C Cosmetics ''Ricky and Nicki for Viva Glam'' campaign. The advertisements for the range paired him with rapper Nicki Minaj. Martin's signature is featured on the lip balm packaging. CANNOTANSWER
