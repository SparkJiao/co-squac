\hspace{15pt}{\textbf{Section}:Massive Attack -- Ritual Spirit EP, new album, and the return of Tricky0\\}
\\ Context: In a 2013 interview for his first solo art show since 2008, Del Naja confirmed that not only was a new Massive Attack album in the works, but that rumours of a reunion with Tricky were true. Tricky had not been featured on a Massive Attack album since 1994's Protection. ''The idea is to put a record out next year'', he says. ''We actually get on really well at the moment because we don't spend time in the studio together'', he says with a wry grin. ''Me and Tricky wrote some new tracks in Paris last year, which haven't seen the light of day yet - but that was fun. They should be on the next album.'' On 5 February 2014, it was confirmed that Massive Attack would headline at Secret Solstice, a new music festival in Reykjavik on 20 June through 22 June. On 21 February 2015, it was confirmed through the Massive Attack Facebook page that they would be collaborating with Run the Jewels. On 21 January 2016, the iPhone application ''Fantom'' was released. The application was developed by a team including Massive Attack's Robert Del Naja and let users hear parts of four new songs by remixing them in real time, using the phone's location, movement, clock, heartbeat, and camera. On 28 January 2016, Massive Attack released a new EP, Ritual Spirit, which includes the four songs released on Fantom. The EP was written and produced by Del Naja and long term collaborator, Euan Dickinson. It was their first release since the 2011 Four Walls / Paradise Circus collaboration with Burial, and the first time since 1994 that fellow trip hop musician Tricky had been featured on Massive Attack content. Scottish hip-hop group Young Fathers, London rapper Roots Manuva and singer Azekel also featured on the EP. On 26 July 2016, Massive Attack previewed three new songs: ''Come Near Me'', ''The Spoils'', and ''Dear Friend'' on Fantom, an iPhone application on which they previously previewed the four songs from the Ritual Spirit EP. On 29 July 2016, they released a new single, ''The Spoils'', which includes ''The Spoils'' and ''Come Near Me'' which were both previewed on Fantom. ''The Spoils'' features vocals from American singer-songwriter and Mazzy Star frontwoman Hope Sandoval, and ''Come Near Me'' features British vocalist Ghostpoet. A music video for ''Come Near Me'', directed by Ed Morris, and featuring Kosovan actress Arta Dobroshi, was released the same day as the single. The video for ''The Spoils'', featuring Cate Blanchett, and directed by Australian director John Hillcoat, was released on 9 August 2016. CANNOTANSWER
