\\ Context: ''Everything happens for the best,'' my mother said whenever I was disappointed. ''If you go on, one day something good will happen.'' When I graduated from college, I decided to try for a job in a radio station and then work hard to become a sports announcer . I took a taxi to Chicago and knocked on the door of every station, but I was t   every time because I didn't have any working experience. Then, I went back home. My father said Montgomery Ward wanted a sports-man to help them. I applied , but I didn't get the job, either. I was very disappointed.''Everything happens for the best,'' Mom reminded me. Dad let me drive his car to look for jobs. I tried WOC Radio in Davenport, Iowa. The program director, Peter MacArthur, told me they had already had an announcer. His words made me disappointed again. After leaving his office, I was waiting for the elevator when I heard MacArthur calling after me, ''What did you say about sports? Do you know anything about football?'' Then he asked me to broadcast an imaginary game. I did so and Peter told me that I would be broadcasting Saturday's game! On my way home, I thought of my mother's words again:''If you go on, one day something good will happen.'' CANNOTANSWER
