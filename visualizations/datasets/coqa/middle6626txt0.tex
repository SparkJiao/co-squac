\\ Context: Thelma was such a life-loving and easy-going person that she was always full of energy and never felt sad. When she was at the age of 75, her husband passed away. Her children were afraid she was lonely and suggested that she move to a ''Senior living community ''. Thelma thought that was a good idea and decided to do so. Shortly after moving in, Thelma became many activities' director. She loved to organize all kinds of things for the people in the community. So quickly she became very popular and made many friends. When Thelma turned 80, her new friends showed their appreciation by throwing a surprise birthday party for her. When Thelma entered the dining room for dinner that night, she was greeted by a standing ovation and one of   led her to the head table. The night was filled with laughter and entertainment, but throughout the evening, Thelma could not take her eyes off a gentleman sitting at the other end of the table. When the party ended, Thelma quickly rose from her seat and rushed over to the man ''Pardon me,'' Thelma said, ''Please forgive me if I made you feel uncomfortable by   at you all night. I just couldn't help myself from looking your way. You see, you look just like my fifth husband.'' ''Your fifth husband!'' replied the gentleman. ''Forgive me for asking, but how many times have you been married? '' With that, a smile appeared on Thelma's face as she replied, ''Four.'' They were married shortly after that. CANNOTANSWER
