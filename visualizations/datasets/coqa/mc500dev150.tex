\\ Context: One day Mary took a walk to the park. The park was very close to her house. One her way to the park she passed her friend Kim's house. Mary stopped by and asked if Kim wanted to play. Kim said yes. Mary and Kim walked together to the park. John's house was three houses down. Mary and Kim stopped by to ask John if he wanted to play at the park. John said no. He was afraid of being chased by a squirrel. Mary worried that John didn't like her, but John thought she was a good friend. So Mary and Kim went to the park to play. They loved the park. They loved the flowers, and the swings! Soon it was dinnertime and the girls went home. What a lovely day at the park. CANNOTANSWER
