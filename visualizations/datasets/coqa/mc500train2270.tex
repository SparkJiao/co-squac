\\ Context: It's finally the weekend of Halloween and I get to dress up in my lion costume. Halloween is my favorite holiday because I really like candy and love dressing up. Last year I was a ghost, but this year I am a lion. My little brother is dressed like a dinosaur and he keeps chewing on everything. He is only 3 years old so I guess that is okay. His name is Todd and his favorite holiday is his birthday but I don't think he knows much about any of them. My dad loves Christmas and my Mom really likes Thanksgiving. But I love Halloween. We have to wait for my dad to come home from work so we can go out and trick-or-treat. While we are waiting my mommy cooks us dinner. She wants us to eat good food before we spoil our dinner with all the candy we are going to get. I can't wait to go to my friend Kevin's house. His parents give the best candy and give me extra since Kevin is my friend. I think Kevin said he was going to dress up like a pirate but I don't remember. I don't think pirates are very cool, but I didn't tell Kevin that. I think I hear my dad coming up the stairs. Tonight is going to be the best Halloween ever. CANNOTANSWER
