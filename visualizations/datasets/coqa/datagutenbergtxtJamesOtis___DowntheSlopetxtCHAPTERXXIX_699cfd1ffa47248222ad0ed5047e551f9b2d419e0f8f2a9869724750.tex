\\ Context: CHAPTER XXIX A QUESTION OF TITLE It was as if each person who had doubted Sam's honesty felt it necessary to call at Mrs. Byram's and congratulate him upon what now appeared to be good proof of his innocence. Fred and the miners also came in for their share of attention, and even Bill, whose limb was paining him severely, joined his partners in celebrating their victory, which now seemed certain. Before returning home Mr. Hunter called to consult with his clients relative to making a stock company of the new mine, and, when he left, it was with full authority to do whatever he believed their interests demanded. Among the visitors in the evening was Donovan, and he had no hesitation in calling himself very severe names for having been so stupid as to think it possible his old friends could have been engaged in any questionable transaction. ''The cashier is about as sore a man as can be found in town,'' he said, ''an' if I ain't way off in my reckonin' he'll be lookin' for another job mighty soon.'' ''Does he say anything against us?'' Bill asked. ''He's glum as a fish. Every feller who goes in wants to know where Gus is, an' he keeps out of sight all that's possible.'' ''Have you seen Mr. Wright to-day?'' ''No; but I heard he an' that lawyer of yours had a long chin about the business. Say, Bill, by the time you get out of this scrape you'll owe a pretty penny for law, I reckon. Why don't you try to make the company pay it?'' CANNOTANSWER
