\\ Context: (CNN) -- Brad Pitt clearly has a great deal going on. Between being dad to six children, a fiancÃ©, an activist and a perfume pitchman, he still manages to squeeze in some time acting. The movie star recently sat down with ''Showbiz Tonight's'' A.J. Hammer to talk about his latest project, the mob film ''Killing Them Softly,'' and that nagging question of when he plans to marry partner Angelina Jolie. A.J. Hammer: Brad, we've got a mob movie and I believe the first one we've seen that has political campaign speeches throughout it. Brad Pitt: I like to mix it up. Hammer: Was this -- for you -- as much about making a mob movie as it was about sending a political message? Pitt: This is a good friend of mine, the writer and director, Andrew Dominik, he's from Australia, and his view of America was very interesting to me. His feeling in some way oppressed and that we get caught up in trying to sell the idea that the image is more important than the actual substance. This is what he was trying to tell with this story. He finds this book about a crime syndicate, and he makes these comparisons to -- not politics, per se, or not just politics, but ... the financial crisis itself, and it was a good subject matter. Hammer: I know, and timely! The idea of the mob dealing with corporate concerns or falling off a fiscal cliff. How timely is that coming off this political season? CANNOTANSWER
