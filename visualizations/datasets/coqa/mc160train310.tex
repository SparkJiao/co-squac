\\ Context: Ryan and Adam love to play basketball. They like it better than soccer and baseball. Their other friend, Jared, has his own basketball hoop. He got it for his ninth birthday. Ryan got a football for his birthday and Adam got a skateboard. They like their presents, but think the basketball hoop is better. They play basketball at Jared's house with him and any other kids who show up. Alex and Brady come almost every day and Josh, Ty, and Max come sometimes. Next year, they all get to play on a basketball team. They get to play at their school. They are very excited about that and can't wait to play on a real team. For now, they are practicing a lot and are trying to get really good. They play every day they can. They are trying to be as good as the NBA players they watch on TV. They dream of someday playing in the NBA. They are sure it is going to happen. CANNOTANSWER
