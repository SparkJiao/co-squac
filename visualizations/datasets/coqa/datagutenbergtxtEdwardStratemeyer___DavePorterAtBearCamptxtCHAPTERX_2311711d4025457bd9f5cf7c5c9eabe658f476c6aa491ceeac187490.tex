\\ Context: CHAPTER X CAUGHT IN A STORM ''Did you ever know this Wilbur Poole, Dad?'' questioned Ben. ''Yes, I met him years ago at Aaron Poole's home. But of course he was in his right mind then. Poor chap! I pity him very much.'' ''I think we all pity him,'' answered Dave. ''Nobody can be responsible after his mind breaks down.'' ''I feel sorry for Nat Poole and his folks,'' said Laura. ''This will give them a great deal of trouble, not to mention the expense.'' ''If Wilbur Poole was anywhere around Rayville it might pay to start a hunt for him,'' suggested Roger. ''I don't think you'll find him anywhere around here,'' answered Mr. Basswood. ''But it won't hurt to take a look around, if you boys care to take a walk.'' Ben's father went off to send his telegram to Aaron Poole, and all the boys set off on a hunt for the wild man. They covered the streets of the village and some of the roads on the outskirts, but without success. They met three people who had talked to the strange individual, and from what had passed Dave and his chums were sure that the man must have been Wilbur Poole. ''I guess we'll have to give it up,'' said Phil, when it was getting late. ''I'm tired out. And remember, fellows, we have a hard ride before us to-morrow if we expect to reach Carpen Falls in time to hit the trail for Bear Camp before it gets dark.'' CANNOTANSWER
