\\ Context: A young mother had a child that was in kindergarten. One day, the class took a trip to the zoo. This was the start of a very good day. The child had a lot of fun. The animals were very friendly, and the friendliest of all was a baby tiger, which the child called 'kitty'. The mother laughed when her child asked to see a unicorn. Instead, she gave her daughter a cookie and they had some ham sandwiches for lunch. They had lunch by the stone benches in the park area. There was a trashcan nearby. The mother threw their trash in the trashcan when they were done. Then they went to go see the pigs. The pigs made a noise like 'oink'. There were also cows. There was also a slide. The slide was a water slide, and the child begged her mother to let her go down it. At the end of the day, the child was dirty and tired, but she had a lot of fun. CANNOTANSWER
