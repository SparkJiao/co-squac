\\ Context: (CNN) -- Chelsea's star striker Didier Drogba has been suffering from malaria, his club manager revealed on Tuesday, but the Ivory Coast player will still line up for the London derby against Fulham in the English Premier League on Wednesday. Drogba started on the bench for Chelsea's 2-0 defeat to Liverpool on Sunday, having missed recent matches against Aston Villa and Spartak Moscow due to a suspected virus. However, the results of blood tests showed that he had in fact contracted the tropical disease. ''A test showed malaria,'' Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti told his club's official website. ''He lost his condition, he lost power. ''Didier had a difficulty to train because he didn't feel good, he didn't have power to train. He was unselfish to play also when he was not 100 percent.'' But the Italian said Drogba was now back to health and would be fit for the league leaders' home clash with Fulham on Wednesday. ''He suffered obviously but after treatment, he will be better,'' Ancelotti said. ''One time it was serious, now there is the possibility to treat and come back well. He is okay. Tomorrow he will play.'' Ancelotti said Ghana midfielder Michael Essien would return to the Chelsea line-up, having missed the Liverpool game with a toe problem, but Frank Lampard is not yet ready to make his long-awaited return. The England midfielder, who has been sidelined following a hernia operation, is scheduled to make his comeback against Sunderland on Sunday. ''Lampard has been training with us and he is good. He is able to play; he is fit because he worked very hard physically,'' Ancelotti said. CANNOTANSWER
