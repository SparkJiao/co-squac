\hspace{15pt}{\textbf{Section}:1973 oil crisis0\\}
\\ Context: The 1973 oil crisis began in October 1973 when the members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC, consisting of the Arab members of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria) proclaimed an oil embargo. By the end of the embargo in March 1974, the price of oil had risen from US 3 per barrel to nearly  12 globally; US prices were significantly higher. The embargo caused an oil crisis, or ''shock'', with many short- and long-term effects on global politics and the global economy. It was later called the ''first oil shock'', followed by the 1979 oil crisis, termed the ''second oil shock.'' CANNOTANSWER
