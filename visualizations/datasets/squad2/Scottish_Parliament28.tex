\hspace{15pt}{\textbf{Section}:Scottish Parliament28\\}
\\ Context: Royal assent: After the bill has been passed, the Presiding Officer submits it to the Monarch for royal assent and it becomes an Act of the Scottish Parliament. However he cannot do so until a 4-week period has elapsed, during which the Law Officers of the Scottish Government or UK Government can refer the bill to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom for a ruling on whether it is within the powers of the Parliament. Acts of the Scottish Parliament do not begin with a conventional enacting formula. Instead they begin with a phrase that reads: ''The Bill for this Act of the Scottish Parliament was passed by the Parliament on [Date] and received royal assent on [Date]''. CANNOTANSWER
