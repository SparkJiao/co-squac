\hspace{15pt}{\textbf{Section}:Blob (comics)0\\}
\\ Context: Blob appears briefly in the Age of Apocalypse as a test subject that Henry McCoy was toying with in the Breeding Pens in a direct violation of the Kelly Pact that Apocalypse signed in order to keep the Human High Council occupied and at bay while he rallied his forces. McCoy considered Blob's mutation useless which enraged Blob. Dukes freed himself, and attacked his experimenter. Havok came to McCoy's rescue, but Dukes proved to be even too much for the Prelate to handle. His pseudo freedom was fleeting for moments later the head of the pens, Havok's older brother Cyclops, showed up to deliver a searing optic blast that would put him back in his place. When the Age of Apocalypse was revisited in the 10th anniversary, Blob was a member of Sinister's team known as Sinister Six. It appears that McCoy or Sinister himself had his powers altered in a manner that allowed Blob to project his gravitational field outward. When the Sinister Six met the X-Men in battle, Dukes' new powers were used to sweep the X-Men off their feet with the Silver Samurai receiving a double dose. Quicksilver attempted to fell the behemoth with multiple punches, but Dukes remained standing regardless of how many hits he got in. It was not until Rogue stepped in with a punch that had the power necessary to overtake him that the mammoth would topple over. Following the Sinister Six's defeat, Blob managed to escape. Later he's seen as a member of the Black Legion, a group of psychotic altered mutants under the supervision of a now insane Weapon X. It is also revealed that he left the Age of Apocalypse timeline and joined Archangel's quest to become the new heir of Apocalypse. He's seen in Akkaba Metropolis under the North Pole and he was the one to prevent the escape of Psylocke. In the ''Final Execution Saga'' story line in Uncanny X-Force, Fredrick is part of a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants led by Daken with the aim of taking down X-Force and turning Evan Sabahnur into a new Apocalypse. During the saga the X-Force team is captured and tortured after Nightcrawler from the Age of Apocalypse universe betrays the team, to get his revenge on Fredrick due to him eating his wife Linda. Kurt seemingly succeeds in his goal of revenge by teleporting a live shark into Fredrick's stomach during a fight with him, causing him to be devoured from within. CANNOTANSWER
