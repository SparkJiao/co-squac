\hspace{15pt}{\textbf{Section}:Nicole Scherzinger0\\}
\\ Context: In January 2014, Scherzinger signed with Sony Music Entertainment for a reported  4.5 million record deal. The following month, she announced she signed a multi-album deal with RCA Records. Scherzinger's second studio album, Big Fat Lie was released in October; on the UK Albums Chart it spent two weeks inside the top 100 peaking at number 17; its poor sales led to her departure from RCA Records. The album was preceded by the singles ''Your Love'', ''Run'' and ''On the Rocks''; the foremost peaked at number six on the UK Singles Chart and was a moderate success on other international markets. In December, Scherzinger made her West End debut starring as Grizabella in the 2014 revival of the musical Cats at the London Palladium where she played the role for a 12-week run until February 8, 2015; her performance received rave reviews from critics particularly praising her rendition of the song standard ''Memory'' and garnered a Laurence Olivier Award nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role in a Musical. Scherzinger was set to reprise Grizabella in the Broadway revival of Cats but a week before rehearsals she quit after producers refused to give her top billing. On June 30, 2015 Scherzinger was crowned as the winner of the variety show I Can Do That where six celebrities compete with each other by performing skills that they never knew they had. In July she performed the American national anthem at the A Capitol Fourth concert in Washington, D.C. and during the opening of the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games. Best Time Ever with Neil Patrick Harris, a live television variety series premiered on September 15, 2015 on NBC with Scherzinger as the co-host. On October 22, the new music panel show Bring the Noise premiered on Sky 1 hosted by Ricky Wilson with Scherzinger and Tinie Tempah joining him as team captains. After a 3-year break from The X Factor, Scherzinger returned in August 2016, for its thirteenth series; she mentored the Boys category, in which her act Matt Terry won the competition. She voiced the part of Sina in the animated feature Moana, which was released on November 23, 2016 through Walt Disney Pictures. Sherzinger co-starred in Dirty Dancing, a remake of the 1987 film of the same name, which aired on ABC on May 24, 2017. Although the movie received negative reviews from critics, Scherzinger's performance received praise. In September, she was a judge on the X Factor UK for her fourth year, in the programmes fourteenth series. CANNOTANSWER
