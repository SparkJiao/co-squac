\hspace{15pt}{\textbf{Section}:Lindsay McDougall0\\}
\\ Context: In August 1996 Lindsay McDougall joined Australian punk rock band Frenzal Rhomb after original guitarist Ben Costello left to attend university and become an animal rights activist. Frenzal Rhomb had formed in Sydney in 1992 with mainstay Jason Whalley on lead vocals. In November 1996 the group issued a CD EP, Punch in the Face and, in January 1997, performed at Big Day Out. Late that year they toured the United States supporting less than jake with Blink-182 opening. In September 1997, the band released their third album, Meet the Family. It was their first to be certified gold by Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The next Frenzal Rhomb LP, A Man's Not a Camel was released in March 1999 and was supported by a nationwide tour. It remains their highest placed album to date, reaching No. 11 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It spawned their highest charting single, ''You Are Not My Friend'', which reached No. 48. The song was co-written by McDougall with fellow band members Whalley, Lex Feltham and Gordy Forman. In April 2003 the band released Sans Souci, followed by Forever Malcolm Young in 2006. During 2003 McDougall organised Rock Against Howard, a compilation album, by various Australian musicians as a protest against incumbent Prime Minister, John Howard's government. It was released in August 2004, before the October federal election, when Howard's coalition was re-elected. Also that year, McDougall and Whalley formed a side-project, Self Righteous Brothers, as an alternative rock group and issued the album, Love Songs for the Wrong at Heart on Shock Records. A track, ''There's No Town Like Snowtown'' referenced the Snowtown murders and was labelled ''insensitive'' by the Adelaide Tourism Commission after being played on radio. For the album, McDougall provided lead vocals, acoustic and electric guitars, banjo, piano, violin, viola, cello, pan flute, glockenspiel, zither, timbales, and cymbals. In March 2009 Frenzal Rhomb undertook The Boys are Back in Brown Tour, the following year they toured Japan and played a number of festivals in Australia, including Come Together and Rollercoaster. In December 2010, they joined the No Sleep Til Festival Tour with punk and metal bands: Megadeth, Descendents, NOFX, Gwar and Dropkick Murphys. In August 2011 Frenzal Rhomb issued their next album Smoko at the Pet Food Factory. CANNOTANSWER
