\\ Context: On November 15, 2016, the band announced that in celebration of its upcoming fifteenth year anniversary, they would be embarking on the Quince Anos Tour in March and April 2017, with support from Counterparts, Movements, and Like Pacific. To commemorate the event, the band performed it's 2006 album Still Searching in full, alongside a collection of career spanning songs. On the same day, the band announced the release of their long teased acoustic EP, ''In Your Absence''. It features 3 brand new songs, alongside acoustic renditions of ''Lost and Found'' from Still Searching, and ''Family Tradition'' from Life Is Not A Waiting Room. A music video was released for the lead single, ''Jets to Peru'', on January 26, 2017. The EP released on March 3, 2017 alongside the beginning of the Quince Anos Tour. The band entered the studio with Saosin guitarist Beau Burchell, who also handled recording duties on In Your Absence, to begin recording their seventh full-length album on June 27, 2017, to be titled If There Is Light, It Will Find You. Nielsen commented that the album would feature a style more akin to earlier releases, such as Let It Enfold You. The album will be written entirely by Nielsen. On August 2, it was revealed that former drummer Dan Trapp would be performing drums on the album, although current drummer Chris Hornbrook would still be performing and touring with the band. However on January 8, 2018, Hornbrook announced his departure from the band. Hornbrook had been touring with Dhani Harrison during the recording sessions. On February 1, 2018, Steve Carey of The Color Morale was announced as the bands new drummer, following the announcement that The Color Morale would be entering a hiatus. On November 30, the lead single ''Double Cross'' was released. A second single, ''Gold Jacket, Green Jacket...'' was released on January 11, 2018. On February 1, 2018, a third single, ''New Jersey Makes, the World Takes'' was released. The album was released on February 16th, 2018. CANNOTANSWER
