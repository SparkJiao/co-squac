\hspace{15pt}{\textbf{Section}:Atomic Kitten0\\}
\\ Context: In April 2003, the album Atomic Kitten was released in the United States, which consisted of tracks from their first two albums. The album was unsuccessful, although ''The Tide Is High (Get the Feeling)'' appeared on the soundtrack for the Disney Channel Original Movie The Lizzie McGuire Movie. Following this, the group opted to focus solely on the European, Oceanian, South African and Asian markets. Before recording their third album, Kool & the Gang approached the group about a collaboration for their album of duets, Odyssey. Kool & the Gang wanted to record an updated version of their hit ''Ladies Night'' and were looking for a girl group to sing the lyrics. Atomic Kitten liked the idea and inquired whether they could use it for their next album which was subsequently named Ladies Night in honour of this collaboration. Atomic Kitten spent late 2002 and early 2003 in the studio recording their third and final studio album. Up until the recording of Ladies Night, the group mainly relied on songwriters, though they had occasionally co-written songs featured on their albums. While recording Ladies Night, they decided to be directly involved in the creation of eight of the fifteen songs. Ladies Night was released on 10 November 2003 and peaked at number five in the UK album chart. It was certified Platinum for sales in excess of 300,000 copies. The album released the group including ''Be With You'', ''Ladies Night'' and ''If You Come To Me'' (which peaked at number three on the UK top 40). A deluxe edition of her third album was released with extra tracks including remixes of Be With You, Ladies Night and Someone Like Me. In early 2004, a tour to support the Ladies Night album and the upcoming release of their Greatest Hits album was planned. Shortly before the tour kicked off, the group announced they would be taking an extended break after the completion of the tour. After the group's 2012 reunion, it was revealed during The Big Reunion that Hamilton had quit the group under the pressure of being a new mom and touring, which later led to the band splitting because they didn't want to replace Hamilton.
