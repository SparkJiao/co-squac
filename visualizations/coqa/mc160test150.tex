\\ Context: A boy was trying to pick out what instrument that he wanted to play. His parents wanted him to pick a good one because playing an instrument was very important to them. So, the boy went to a music store with his parents. When he got there he didn't know where to start, so the boy walked up to the front and asked the man who worked there for help. First the worker brought the boy to a piano. ''No way,'' said the boy, ''that looks way too hard!'' The worker laughed at this, and then brought out a guitar. The boy thought that guitars were too popular and wanted to play something that not many other people would play. Finally, the worker brought the boy to the drums. ''That's it! That is a cool instrument that I could really get into.'' However, his mom wasn't so happy with this because she thought that he would be too loud. The boy's dad stepped in and talked her into it because he knew that if the boy liked what he did, he would do way better. Twenty years later, and the boy was the drummer in a band. It the most popular rock band in the world. CANNOTANSWER
