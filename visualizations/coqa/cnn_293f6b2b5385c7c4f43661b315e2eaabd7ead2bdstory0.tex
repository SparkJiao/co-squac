\\ Context: (EW.com ) -- When last we saw Olivia Pope, she was flying off into the sunset (or maybe just flying off) with Jake by her sideâ€”leaving behind a broken Fitz, who'd just lost his son and realized some horrible things about his father. D.C. now rests in the hands of Olivia's own father, who once again took over B-613. So what awaits the team when season four starts up? How about a new face? EW has confirmed that ''Arrested Development'' star Portia de Rossi will join ''Scandal's'' fourth season for a multiple-episode arc. Ellen DeGeneres first announced the news on Twitter, bragging about her wife's ''top secret'' storyline. Could the words ''top secret'' mean de Rossi is a part of Papa Pope's B-613 army? We'll find out Thursday, Sept. 25 at 9 p.m., when Scandal returns on ABC. ABC fall premiere dates announced: 'Scandal' returns Former 'Scandal' actor Columbus Short arrested in Texas See the original story at EW.com CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly © 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc.
