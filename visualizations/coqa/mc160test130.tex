\\ Context: Little Tommy woke one morning to the sun shining and the birds singing. He had a bird that would sit outside his window that he named Martha. He really liked Martha and he fed her some bread every morning. When he was done feeding Martha he would go and feed his best buddy ever, Sammy, a big hairy dog. Tommy really loved Sammy and hung out with him all day, every day. Today he thought they would go fishing and enjoy the sunshine. Tommy found his fishing pole, some worms, and a little lunch for the day. Off Tommy and Sammy went for the day. When they got to the fishing hole Sammy ran over to a rock and started barking with his hair standing up. Tommy ran to see what Sammy had found. Under the edge of the rock was a huge green toad. Tommy laughed and laughed at Sammy and calmed him down then picked up the toad. Sammy was very interested and licked the toad. Sammy found a new friend. Tommy took the toad home with them and named him Zoe the Toadie. CANNOTANSWER
